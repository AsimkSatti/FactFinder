# FactFinder: A Google Chrome Extension by Asim Satti & William Uchegbu
When conducting research one often comes along long articles or complete notes for that matter and are not able or willing to read the entire passage for the desired information. A page finder matched with facts- FactFinder parses through the entire page quickly and displays in a user friendly format highlighted facts from the page effectively skimming for the information. 
Disclaimer: It does not display all facts on a page it uses a sophisticated algorithm ensuring that only facts displayed within FactFinder yet not all facts from the page could possibly be placed. Does not substitute reading.
